- 👋 Hi, I’m @NewCodehere
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use python 3
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my codes, I'm trying to learn and want other people to review my codes and tell me how to improve. I know my codes are quite long and can be 
compressed and made better. I would love to hear everyones advice so I can improve!
